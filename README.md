# Middle Passage Deaths

The CSV, KMZ, and KML files all contain the same data and can be used in a GIS to map some voygages on the Middle Passage of the Atlantic slave trade during the eighteenth century. Users are free to create derivative works as long as they credit me as the source and license their own derivative products under the same GNU General Public License v3.0. The files each contain 1,647 records with fields for the name of the vessel, its type, date, day, daily noontime latitude, longitude, number of enslaved people who embarked, who died while on the African coast, who began the Middle Passage, who disembarked in Suriname, the daily number of deaths among the men, women, boys, girls, and those of unrecorded age and gender, births, and the archival reference.

For more information on the primary sources, methods, and analysis, please see my article in the journal *Esclavages & post-esclavages / Slaveries & Post-Slaveries*, which is available [here](https://journals.openedition.org/slaveries/263). The article is, at this time, forthcoming but supposed to appear sometime in 2020. Once published, I will update this Read Me with the DOI and abstract so anyone who wants to use the database to create derivative products has complete contextual information.
