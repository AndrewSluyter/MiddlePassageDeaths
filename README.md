# Middle Passage Deaths

The CSV, KMZ, and KML files all contain the same data and can be used in a GIS to map 25 voygages on the Middle Passage of the Atlantic slave trade during the eighteenth century. The data come from logbooks of the Middelburgsche Commercie Compagnie archived in the Zeeuws Archief, Middelburg, The Netherlands. Users are free to create derivative works as long as they credit me as the source and license their own derivative products under the same GNU General Public License v3.0. The files each contain 1,647 records with fields for the name of the vessel, its type, date, day, daily noontime latitude, longitude, number of enslaved people who embarked, who died while on the African coast, who began the Middle Passage, who disembarked in Suriname, the daily number of deaths among the men, women, boys, girls, and those of unrecorded age and gender, births, and the archival reference.

For more information on the primary sources, methods, and analysis, please see my article "Death on the Middle Passage: A Cartographic Approach to the Atlantic Slave Trade" in the journal *Esclavages & post-esclavages / Slaveries & Post-Slaveries*, which was published November 27, 2020 and is available [here](https://journals.openedition.org/slaveries/3358). It provides more complete metadata and other contextual information for anyone who wants to use the database to create derivative products.
